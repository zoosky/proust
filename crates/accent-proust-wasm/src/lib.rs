//! WebAssembly bindings for [`accent_proust`], for a browser or any other
//! JavaScript host.
//!
//! The library performs no I/O, reads no configuration and decides no HTML
//! policy; everything host-specific reaches it through a seam. A WebAssembly
//! ABI is one more host, so it lives in this crate rather than behind a feature
//! flag in the library: `crate-type` is not conditional, and a `cdylib` feature
//! would change how every native consumer links.
//!
//! # The pipeline, one call per stage
//!
//! ```js
//! import init, { validate, renderHtml, transform, format } from "accent-proust";
//! await init();
//!
//! const errors = validate(source);   // diagnostics, before anything renders
//! const html   = renderHtml(source); // the preview
//! const tree   = transform(source);  // for a React or Vue renderer
//! const clean  = format(source);     // canonical Markdoc source
//! ```
//!
//! Stages are separate because a preview pane needs the diagnostics, not only
//! the markup. Collapsing them into one `markdocToHtml` would throw away the
//! reason to use Markdoc over Markdown.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary
//!
//! Values are built as JavaScript objects directly rather than serialised to
//! JSON and parsed back, so a number is formatted by the engine and this crate
//! does not reimplement ECMAScript's `ToString`. The two mappings that have a
//! shape to honour are documented where they live: [`tree`] for the renderable
//! tree, and [`diagnostics`] for validation errors.
//!
//! Every entry point parses from scratch. Nothing is cached between calls and
//! no value holds a borrow across the boundary, which is what makes each of
//! these a plain function rather than a handle the caller has to free.
//!
//! # Not here yet
//!
//! Variables, partials and host-defined tag schemas. Each needs a second
//! mapping -- JavaScript values inward rather than Rust values outward -- and
//! schemas additionally need a way to call a JavaScript hook from inside the
//! validator. Until then these entry points use the built-in configuration
//! from [`accent_proust::builtins::config`], which is upstream's default set of
//! nodes, tags and functions.
